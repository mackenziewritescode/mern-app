# Restful Forum

See it in action [here](https://www.sunkenworld.com/restful-forum).

This app is a personal project I made in order to explore REST APIs. It's designed to have the basic functionality of traditional web forums but with a more modern aesthetic. It takes the typical MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) message board project but adds a layer of depth by allowing a thread of replies for each main post.
